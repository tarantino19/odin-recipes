    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim), I recommend bony cuts such as spare ribs, pork belly with ribs, hocks and knuckles, tailbone or neck bones for better flavor</li>
            <li>Tomatoes-use ripe, juicy tomatoes</li>
            <li>Onion-peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>Fish sauce-brings umami flavor; you can swap with salt if you prefer</li>
            <li>Gabi-adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth</li>
            <li>Radish (labanos)</li>
            <li>Sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, bok choy-these are the vegetables I used but feel free to use other local produce available such as kangkong (water spinach) and pechay</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to Cook & Prepare</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash tamarind pods under cold, running water to remove any grit or dirt from the skins.</li>
            <li>Place in a saucepan with about 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until soft and outer skins begin to burst.            </li>
            <li>Using a fork, mash the tamarinds to release the pulp. </li>
            <li>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, place the tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.
            </li>
            <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.
            </li>
        </ul>
